'''Constructs the non-linearity curve (NLCurve) for analyzing segments of multivariate timecourses.'''

"""
This module analyzes segment lengths induced by changepoints in a timecourse.
The segment frequency is a frequency of count of each segment.
The segment density is a fraction of the total timecourse length that is
    contained in segments of each length.
The cumulative area function (CAF) is a cumulative sum of the segment density, and is the NLCurve.
Two CAF curves are compatible if there last boundary is the same.
The distance between two CAF curves is the area between them.
